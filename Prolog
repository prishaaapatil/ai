Simple Arithmetic
sum(A, B, Result) :- Result is A + B.
multiply(A, B, Result) :- Result is A * B.
divide(A, B, Result) :- Result is A / B.
% A number is even if remainder after division by 2 is 0
even(N) :- 0 is N mod 2.
% A number is odd if remainder after division by 2 is 1
odd(N) :- 1 is N mod 2.
 even(4).
sum(2, 6, X).

Factorials
% Fact: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(0, 1).
% Rule: factorial of N is N * factorial of N-1
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, R1),
    Result is N * R1.
 factorial(5, F).

Fibonacci Series
% fibonacci(N, F) :- F is the Nth Fibonacci number.
fibonacci(0, 0).  % Base case: fib(0) = 0
fibonacci(1, 1).  % Base case: fib(1) = 1
fibonacci(N, F) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    N2 is N - 2,
    fibonacci(N1, F1),
    fibonacci(N2, F2),
    F is F1 + F2.
fibonacci(5, F).
